CANOPUS visualization for Jupyter notebook

## install

```
python setup.py install --user
```

## usage in Jupyter notebook

See [Tutorial.ipynb](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/kaibioinfo/canopus_treemap/blob/master/Tutorial.ipynb) for a guide. You can read it from github, but javascript objects won't work. Better is to run it locally:
```
jupyter-notebook Tutorial.ipynb
```

Running the notebook in the cloud with [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/kaibioinfo/canopus_treemap/master?urlpath=lab/tree/Tutorial.ipynb).
